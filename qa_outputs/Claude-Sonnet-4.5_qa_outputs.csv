- A large artwork image showing a starry night sky with celestial bodies

Looking at the current screen, the time shows ""8:15"" at the top left corner. A swipe up gesture on this page would typically scroll the content downward to reveal more information below (such as the biography section, birth/death dates, etc.).

Since a swipe up gesture is a content scrolling action and does not trigger any system-level changes or navigation to a different app, the time displayed in the status bar would only change if actual time has passed between screenshots, not as a direct result of the swipe action itself.

Based on the action of clicking an icon in the middle right of the screen, I need to determine if a ""You May Also Like"" section becomes visible.

Looking at this screen, clicking that icon (which appears to be a share or similar function based on its position) would likely trigger a specific function like sharing or viewing related options, but it wouldn't necessarily cause a ""You May Also Like"" recommendations section to appear.

Typically, ""You May Also Like"" sections appear when:
- Scrolling down on the product page

Currently, the alarm is set for ""5 days, 13 hours, and 2 minutes from now"" as shown in the notification at the bottom of the screen. The alarm is set for 8:00 AM on Monday.

When Tuesday is selected in addition to Monday, the alarm will now repeat on both Monday AND Tuesday. Since we're adding an additional day to the alarm's repeat pattern, this will change how far away the next alarm occurrence is from the current time.

Looking at the question: ""Is the alarm still set for 5 days, 13 hours, and 2 minutes in the after state?""

Since we're adding Tuesday as an additional repeat day, the next alarm occurrence will be recalculated. If the current time is 6:58 (as shown at the top), and we're adding Tuesday to the repeat pattern, the countdown timer will change based on when the next occurrence of either Monday or Tuesday at 8:00 AM will be.

The current screenshot shows headlines from the World section, including stories about:
- President Biden's planned visit to Vietnam
- Ohio voting on GOP proposals
- Russian drones near Moscow
- Pakistan's Imran Khan

When returning to the home screen, the app would typically display a mixed selection of top headlines from various categories (Home, India, World, States, Business, etc.) rather than just World news. The home screen curates different content to provide a broader overview of news across all sections.

The headline and article preview are clearly shown, along with an accompanying image of a modernist building.

After scrolling up, this Myron Goldfinger article would move higher on the screen and would indeed appear ""above the fold"" (in the immediately visible area without needing to scroll).

**No**

Wait, let me reconsider. ""Above the fold"" typically refers to content visible without scrolling. If we scroll UP, we're moving to see content that was above the current view. The Myron Goldfinger article is already visible in the current screen. After scrolling up, we would see content that was previously above this article, so the Myron Goldfinger article would actually move DOWN or potentially off-screen.

When this action is performed (clicking the Confirm button), the dialog box will close as the user's selection is confirmed, and the interface will return to the main menu screen showing the pizza options.

Since the dialog containing the Confirm button will be dismissed after clicking it, the button will no longer be visible on the next screen.

After this swipe action, the screen will show magazines further down in the catalog.

However, the ""All categories"" dropdown is part of the fixed header section at the top of the screen. Since this appears to be a standard scrollable list with a persistent header, the ""All categories"" dropdown will remain visible at the top of the screen even after scrolling down.

Clicking the Save button typically adds a video to a playlist or watch later list. This action generally does not change the overall color scheme of the interface - it would likely just show a confirmation message or popup while maintaining the same dark theme background and UI elements.

No",100.0
episode_2748/step_000.jpg,Click on the Save button,"Is the ""Save"" button highlighted after clicking it?",Yes,"Looking at this request, I need to determine what happens to the ""Save"" button after clicking it.

When a user clicks the ""Save"" button on YouTube (visible in the action bar at the bottom of the screen), the expected behavior is that the button will typically change appearance to indicate the action was successful. This is a common UI pattern to provide feedback to users.

Based on standard YouTube mobile interface behavior, after clicking ""Save"", the button would become highlighted or filled (usually changing from an outline to a solid state) to indicate the video has been saved to a playlist or watch later.

**No**

<explanation>
A swipe up gesture typically scrolls content downward to reveal more information below, but it does not modify or recalculate the statistical data already being displayed. The ""average minutes per week"" value (00:13:19) is a calculated statistic based on existing meditation session data. This value would only change if new meditation sessions were added or existing data was modified, not from a simple scroll gesture. The swipe up action will likely just reveal more content below (if any exists), but the statistics themselves will remain the same.

Since the action is to go back from the Technology Magazines category page, the previous screen would have shown whatever view came before browsing this specific category - likely a more general magazine browsing interface or home screen with different magazine titles visible than the technology-focused ones currently shown (The 10 Most Influential Women in Technology, Analytics Insight, Global MDA Journal, etc.).

When you swipe up on a scrollable list or grid of magazines, the content moves upward, which means items currently at the bottom of the screen would move into view, while items at the top would move out of view.

Looking at the current screen, I can see magazines like ""New York Magazine"", ""The Team Roping Journal"", ""iPad & iPadOS 16 For Beginners"", and ""World Coin News"" are visible. If the Fuel magazine is not currently visible and requires a swipe up action to view it, this means it must be positioned below the current viewport.

These are all ""normale"" (normal) sized pizzas in the classic pizza category. Since we can see there are more items below (indicated by the incomplete list), swiping up would reveal additional menu items that are currently off-screen.

Given that this appears to be an alphabetically or categorically ordered menu of classic pizzas, and ""Bismark"" would come before ""Capricciosa"" alphabetically, it's likely already visible above the current view or would appear when scrolling.

episode_18773/step_007.jpg,Swipe right the Latest live drawing ,Did the overall layout of the screen change after swiping right?,No,"Based on the action of swiping right on the Latest live drawing section, I need to analyze what changes would occur on the next screen.

When swiping right on a horizontal scrollable list (like the Latest live drawings carousel), the typical behavior is:
- The list items shift to show different content within the same section
- The visible drawings/images in the carousel change
- The overall screen structure (headers, sections, navigation) remains the same

Looking at the current screen, I can see:
- Header with PENUP logo and icons
- Four category icons at the top
- ""Latest coloring pages"" section
- ""Latest live drawings"" section
- ""Popular today"" section
- Bottom navigation bar

After swiping right on the Latest live drawings, the next state would show:
- The same overall layout structure
- Different live drawing items visible in that section
- All other sections remain unchanged

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the ""Explore"" button is located in a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen, along with ""Play"" and ""Inspire"" buttons.

When scrolling down on this type of interface, the navigation bar typically remains fixed at the bottom as it's a primary navigation element. The content above (the topic buttons like Visual arts, Crafts, Fashion, etc.) would scroll, but the bottom navigation bar would stay in place.

Therefore, after scrolling down, the ""Explore"" button would remain at the bottom of the screen.

Yes",100.0
episode_1024/step_002.jpg,Swipe up to Favorites option,"Is ""Travel"" still listed in the available topics after the action?",Yes,"Based on the action of swiping up to the Favorites option, I need to analyze what would appear on the next screen.

Looking at the current screen, I can see various topics listed including:
- Visual arts
- Crafts
- Fashion
- Nature
- Design
- Travel

The action is to swipe up to Favorites, which would likely navigate to a Favorites section or filter the content to show favorited items.

When navigating to a Favorites section, the screen would typically show only items that have been marked as favorites by the user, not the full list of available topics. However, the question asks if ""Travel"" is still listed in the available topics after the action.

Looking at the bottom navigation bar, there appear to be options for ""Explore"", ""Play"", and ""Inspire"". A Favorites section might be accessed through one of these navigation options or through a separate menu.

Without being able to see the actual next screen, but based on typical app behavior, when you navigate to a Favorites section, you would see your favorited content, not the general topic browsing interface. Therefore, ""Travel"" as a browsing topic would not be visible in a Favorites view.

Looking at the current state, the user is composing an email with:
- A recipient (Cerebra Research)
- A subject line ('Save The Children' loses its FCRA permit)
- Email body content
- The keyboard is currently visible at the bottom of the screen

When the send button is clicked, the email will be sent. After sending an email, the typical behavior in email applications is to return to either the inbox or the previous screen. The keyboard would typically be dismissed as the composing interface is no longer needed.

In the current state, I can see:
- The constellation name ""Gemini"" is clearly displayed in the information panel
- This is part of the Sun's details section
- The information panel shows various details including Constellation, Magnitude, Distance, and Diameter

When scrolling up to learn more, the screen would typically reveal additional content above the current view.

episode_18773/step_009.jpg,Swipe right the Latest live drawing ,Is there a new live drawing visible in the Latest live drawings section after the swipe?,Yes,"Based on the action of swiping right on the Latest live drawings section, let me analyze what will change on the next screen.

When you swipe right on a horizontally scrollable gallery or carousel (which the Latest live drawings section appears to be), the content will slide to reveal items that were previously off-screen to the left, while the currently visible items will move to the right.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the Latest live drawings section contains several drawing thumbnails. After a right swipe, the carousel will shift, potentially revealing a different drawing that was positioned before the currently visible ones.

To answer the specific question about whether a new live drawing will be visible:

**Yes**",100.0

Looking at the current screen, I can see various filter options like Color, Series, Item Weight, Material, Grade, Sport/Activity, Player Position, Signed, and several toggle options. At the bottom, there's a ""Show 546 results"" button.

When performing a swipe up action on a scrollable list like this, additional filter options or content below the current view would become visible. There is no indication that a ""Show less"" option exists as an actual UI element on this screen. The ""Show less"" functionality would typically appear when content has been expanded, but this appears to be a standard filter menu with a fixed set of options.

episode_18773/step_009.jpg,Swipe right the Latest live drawing ,Has the artwork displayed in the first position under Latest live drawings changed after the swipe?,Yes,"The action of swiping right on the ""Latest live drawings"" section will cause the carousel of drawings to shift, revealing different artworks. Based on the nature of a horizontal swipe gesture in a carousel interface, new content will slide in from the left side while the current items move to the right.

To answer your question: **Yes**

After swiping right, the artwork displayed in the first position under ""Latest live drawings"" will change. The current first drawing (showing bamboo stalks) will move to the right, and a different drawing from earlier in the carousel sequence will appear in the first position.",100.0
episode_11946/step_006.jpg,Scroll up to learn more.,"Is the ""3D"" option visible in both images?",Yes,"Looking at the action ""Scroll up to learn more,"" this would typically reveal more content that is currently below the visible area. However, since the question asks whether the ""3D"" option is visible ""in both images"" (meaning the current state and the next state after scrolling), I need to determine if the 3D option will remain visible.

In the current screenshot, I can clearly see the ""3D"" option/button in the control panel area. When scrolling up to see more content (likely more detailed information about the Sun), the interface typically keeps the main control options like ""Visibility,"" ""3D,"" and other core features visible in a fixed position so users can always access them.

**Yes**",100.0
episode_11946/step_006.jpg,Scroll up to learn more.,Did the scroll action remove the icons for visibility and 3D features in the after state?,No,"The action is to scroll up to learn more. Analyzing the current state and the action, I need to determine if the visibility and 3D features icons will be removed after the scroll action.

Looking at the current interface, I can see two icons labeled ""Visibility"" and ""3D"" near the middle of the screen. The question asks whether these icons will be removed in the next state after scrolling up.

When scrolling up to ""learn more,"" the interface would typically show more detailed information about the Sun, which would likely require expanding the information panel. This expansion would push other elements up or potentially reorganize the interface layout.

Based on the typical behavior of scrolling actions in information panels, and considering that the action is specifically to ""learn more,"" the interface would likely prioritize showing more content, which could result in the removal or repositioning of these control icons.

When swiping right on a content section within the same screen/app, this typically causes horizontal scrolling of that content area to show different items. This is a content-level interaction that doesn't affect the system status bar at the top of the screen.

The battery icon is part of the Android system status bar (visible in the top-right corner at 1:40). System status bar elements remain constant during in-app content interactions like horizontal scrolling or swiping through content carousels.

Therefore, the battery icon will remain unchanged after swiping right on the ""Latest live drawings"" section.

When swiping up on a product page, typically more details would be revealed such as pricing information, detailed specifications, and purchasing options. However, the question asks specifically about whether a discount will be shown in the AFTER state.

From the current screenshot, there is no visible indication of any discount or promotional pricing. The ""Amazon's Choice"" badge is present, but this doesn't necessarily indicate a discount. Without seeing any strikethrough prices, discount percentages, or promotional text in the visible portion, and considering that swiping up would show standard product details rather than create new promotional offers, the answer is:

When scrolling up on a mobile screen, content typically moves upward, meaning items that were previously visible at the bottom may move off-screen, while items from below the current view would become visible.

In the current screenshot, I can see the Casual section with several items including one labeled ""Aaliyah Hinojosa"". After scrolling up, the screen content will shift upward, which would cause items in the Casual section to move up on the screen. This means ""Aaliyah Hinojosa"" and other items in that section would likely move above the viewport or higher on the screen.

Since the action is scrolling up (not down), content at the bottom of the current view would move upward and potentially off-screen at the top, while new content from below would appear.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a comparison table with different product attributes like rating, price, sold by, value for money, support, comfort, sturdiness, assembly instructions, color, and included components.

When swiping up on a comparison table, the content scrolls vertically to show additional rows that were previously below the visible area. The warranty information is not currently visible in the screenshot, which means it's located further down in the table.

After swiping up, new comparison attributes that were below would come into view, but the warranty description for the first item (the ""This item"" column showing the Wakeup Mushy Premium Fabric Sofa) would remain the same - it would still show ""1 Year Manufacturing Warranty"" if that's what was there before the swipe.

- Amazon's Choice badge
- Product image of a black sneaker

2. The notification drawer would likely close
3. The screen would return to the home screen (or previous screen)

episode_5563/step_006.jpg,Swipe up to view more options.,"Is the offer code ""MSFAN65"" displayed after the swipe up?",No,"The screenshot shows an e-commerce mobile app interface with various promotional banners and sales. I can see a prominent banner advertising ""FANTASTIC FASHION SALE"" from 3 PM to 6 PM with ""FLAT 65% OFF"" and a discount code section at the bottom.

Looking at the promotional banner, I can clearly see a code box that displays ""CODE : MSFAN65"" in the lower portion of the sale banner.

When the user swipes up to view more options, the content below the current visible area will scroll into view. However, the question asks specifically about the offer code ""MSFAN65"" being displayed after the swipe up action.

Since the code ""MSFAN65"" is already visible in the current screen before any swipe action, and swipe up would scroll to show content that is currently below the visible area, the answer to whether this specific code will be displayed after swiping up depends on whether it remains in the visible viewport or scrolls out of view.

Given that swiping up typically brings new content from below into view and may push current content upward or out of the screen, the ""MSFAN65"" code that is currently visible might scroll up and potentially out of view.

When swiping up, the screen will scroll upward, revealing more content that is currently below the visible area. Looking at the visible elements, I can see there is more content in the System section that extends beyond what's currently visible.

After the swipe up action, the screen will shift to show content that was previously below the viewport. Based on common UI patterns in settings screens like this, additional options would appear in the System section.

Looking at the typical behavior of news article layouts, when scrolling up to read more content at the top, the title usually stays in view as it's positioned at the top of the article content.

When you swipe up to Notifications from the current account settings screen, you would be navigating to a different section of the app - specifically the Notifications area. This would replace the current view (which shows account information, saved articles, account settings, privacy settings, and log out options) with the Notifications interface.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see ""Out of Stock"" displayed in the upper right portion of the screen. A swipe up action would typically scroll the page content upward, revealing content that was below the current viewport. However, this action would not change the actual stock status of the product - it would only change what portion of the page is visible.

The stock status is a data attribute of the product that is determined by inventory levels, not by user interface actions like scrolling. Swiping up would simply show different parts of the same product page, but the ""Out of Stock"" status would remain the same.

When a ""next"" button is tapped in an image gallery or selection screen, this typically triggers navigation to show different content - either scrolling to display more images or advancing to another page/screen. This would result in either:
1. A different set of images being displayed in the same grid layout
2. Moving to a completely different screen

Regarding the action of tapping the ""next"" icon button and the question about the resulting screen:

**No**

After tapping the next/forward button (visible as a blue circular button with an arrow at the bottom right), the screen will likely proceed to the next step in whatever workflow this is part of (such as a collage creation, slideshow, or sharing interface), rather than continuing to display a gallery of images. The interface would transition from the image selection view to a different type of screen.

Looking at the current screen, I can see ""MV Deal 4"" at the bottom of the visible area, which includes ""Large 13"" Pizza & 1 Litre Soft-Drink"" as its description.

When swiping right to left to view the pizza menu, this would typically navigate to a different section or category of the menu (likely the regular pizza menu section rather than the deals section). This would change the content displayed on screen entirely, moving away from the deals view to show individual pizza options.

- Details about the Biden administration's $3.5 billion fund
- Specific project information involving Occidental Petroleum Corp., Climeworks AG, Battelle Memorial Institute and Heirloom Carbon Technologies

Since the question asks if the content includes information about the technology discussed, and the visible text after scrolling explicitly discusses ""technology that sucks planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the air"" and mentions specific companies developing ""machines scientists say will be needed to stop the worst effects of climate change,"" the answer is:

- MV Deal 3: Medium 10"" Pizza & 2 Soft Drinks (345 ML)
- MV Deal 4: Large 13"" Pizza & 1 Litre Soft-Drink

After swiping right to left to view the pizza menu, this would typically navigate to a different section of the menu. However, since the question asks specifically about ""MV Deal 3"" and whether the ""Medium 10"" Pizza & 2 Soft Drinks (345 ML)"" is still visible, I need to consider what this swipe action does in this context.

Looking at the interface, there's a horizontal menu bar at the top showing ""Big 2 Better"", ""Royal Crown Pizza"", ""Max Platter"", and ""Appetizers"". The current view appears to be showing the ""Max Platter"" or deals section. A swipe right to left would likely move to the next section (possibly ""Appetizers"").

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a horizontal menu bar with tabs including ""Big 2 Better"", ""Royal Crown Pizza"", ""Max Platter"", and ""Appetizers"". The current view appears to be showing the ""Max Platter"" section with various MV Deal options.

When performing a right-to-left swipe gesture, this typically indicates moving to the next tab or section in the menu. Since we can see ""Royal Crown Pizza"" is one of the tabs in the menu bar, and the question asks if it will still be displayed after the swipe, I need to determine if the tab label itself remains visible.

After a swipe action on a horizontal tab menu like this, the tabs themselves typically remain visible at the top of the screen, even as the content below changes to show a different section. The ""Royal Crown Pizza"" text appears to be a tab label in the navigation menu, which would continue to be displayed in the tab bar even after swiping to view different content.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see we're already viewing the pizza menu with various ""MV Deal"" items displayed. The ""MV Deal 2"" is shown with a price of Rs. 550.00, consisting of a PPan 7"" Pizza & 345ml drink.

A right-to-left swipe on this screen would typically be used to:
1. Switch between different menu categories (shown in tabs like ""Big 2 Better"", ""Royal Crown Pizza"", ""Max Platter"", ""Appetizers"")
2. Navigate to a different section of the app

After performing a right-to-left swipe, the most likely outcome is that the view would switch to show a different menu category, such as moving from the current view to show ""Appetizers"" or another category tab.

To answer the specific question: **No**

The price of ""MV Deal 2"" will not still be Rs. 550 after the swipe because ""MV Deal 2"" itself will likely not be visible on the screen anymore - the swipe will have navigated to a different menu section or category, showing different menu items entirely.",0.0

Currently, the search box is active with the keyboard displayed, and there's a list of recent searches showing ""Heladeria Catania"" as the first result. When the user types ""Heladeria Catania"" in the search box, the app will show search results or suggestions. However, the question asks specifically about whether there will be an option to ""choose on the map"" after this change.

Looking at the current interface, I can see that search results typically include location details and there should be options to view locations on the map.

When viewing the current state, I can see there are 3 artworks displayed. The visible artworks shown at the bottom are labeled as ""Artwork"" (appearing at least twice). After swiping up, the screen would scroll to reveal more content from the list of artworks.

Since the question asks if there are ""any artworks that have new titles after the swipe up,"" this is asking whether the swipe action will reveal additional artworks with different titles than what is currently visible. Given that this appears to be a scrollable list of artworks and swiping up would reveal content below the current view, it's likely that additional artworks in the collection would become visible, though they may have the same generic ""Artwork"" title.

However, looking at the current state more carefully, all visible items seem to have the same title ""Artwork"" rather than unique descriptive titles. A swipe up would likely show more items from the same collection, which would probably also be titled ""Artwork.""

Currently, the screen shows a calendar view for June 2023 with workout history displayed below. There are 3 workouts shown for the week of Jun 18 - Jun 24:
1. FULL BODY - DAY 1 (01:03, 19.7 kcal)
2. CHEST BEGINNER (04:24, 82.7 kcal) 
3. CHEST BEGINNER (03:19, 62.3 kcal)

The total shows ""3 workouts"" with a combined time of 08:47 and 164.7 kcal burned.

When the action is performed to return to the homepage, the UI will transition from this workout history view back to the main homepage of the Home Workout App. The homepage will show the same workout data since no new workouts have been added or removed during this navigation action.

Therefore, the answer to whether the total number of workouts recorded is still at 3 is:

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see ""THE WILD GOAT"" text is displayed over a constellation illustration (which appears to be Capricorn). The text is currently positioned in the middle area of the screen, overlaying the constellation artwork.

When clicking on the middle point of the constellation to view details, this will typically trigger a transition to a detailed information screen or panel about the constellation. In such transitions, UI elements like the constellation name often get repositioned - commonly moving to the top of the screen as a header or title for the details view.

**No**

Wait, let me reconsider. The question asks if the name will be shown in a ""different position"" after clicking. Given that clicking on a constellation typically opens a detail view where the layout changes significantly, and constellation names in detail views are usually positioned differently (often at the top as headers rather than overlaid on the artwork), the answer should be:

**Yes**",100.0

Based on the action description, when the Blank option is clicked, it will open a new blank document for editing. This would typically take the user to the document editing interface, which is a different screen from the current ""New Document"" template selection screen.

Since ""Scan to Word"" is shown as one of the template options on the current template selection screen, and clicking Blank would navigate away from this template selection interface to an actual document editing interface, the ""Scan to Word"" option would no longer be displayed.

No",100.0
episode_14556/step_010.jpg,Scroll down to find Sushi recipe,"Is ""Salad Sushi Rolls"" visible after scrolling down?",No,"Based on the current screenshot and the action of scrolling down to find Sushi recipe, I can see that ""Salad Sushi Rolls"" is already visible on the screen. The recipe card shows:

- Title: ""Salad Sushi Rolls""
- Author: Chandni Udani
- Ingredients including cucumber, dill dipping sauce, crumbled jibna (feta cheese), bell pepper, and lemon
- An accompanying image showing cucumber-wrapped sushi rolls

Since ""Salad Sushi Rolls"" is already visible in the current view before any scrolling action occurs, it will certainly remain visible or still be visible after scrolling down.

- ""tranquil beauty"" (30 mins) - shown on the left
- ""mountain mist"" (45 mins) - shown on the right

When clicking on ""mountain mist,"" this will likely navigate to a detailed view or start playing that specific music track. This would typically replace the current view with either:
1. A music player interface for that track
2. A detailed page about the ""mountain mist"" track

In either case, the current scrollable list view showing multiple tracks including ""tranquil beauty"" would no longer be visible, as the interface would transition to focus on the selected ""mountain mist"" track.

- A search bar at the top
- Individual product reviews with ratings, text, images
- Review details like verified purchase status and dates
- An ""All 10914 reviews"" link at the bottom

After going back from this reviews page, the app would likely return to the product details page. On typical e-commerce product listing or detail pages, there is commonly a ""Filter"" option available to help users sort or filter products by various criteria like price, size, color, ratings, etc.

No

<interface_analysis>
The current screenshot shows a search interface with ""Crab Nebula"" in the search bar and one search result showing the Crab Nebula with visibility information ""Visible before 05:21"". The screen displays a keyboard at the bottom, indicating this is a search state rather than a detailed view. When clicking on the Crab Nebula result, the next screen would typically show detailed astronomical information, but based on standard astronomical app interfaces, the hour angle is not a commonly displayed parameter in basic detail views.

episode_19019/step_001.jpg,Click on the search tab at the bottom of the screen to search for the recipe.,Does the screen show a list of recipes after clicking the search tab?,No,"Based on the action described, I need to analyze what happens when clicking the search tab at the bottom of the screen.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a Kitchen Stories app interface showing an article titled ""The 10 Most Unexpected And Controversial Recipes Of All Time"" by Harriette Richards. At the bottom of the screen, there are three navigation tabs: Today, Search, and Profile.

When the user clicks on the Search tab, the interface would navigate to a search screen. This search screen would typically show:
- A search bar at the top to enter recipe queries
- Either a list of suggested/popular recipes, recent searches, or search categories
- Not immediately a filtered list of recipes (that would appear after entering a search term)

Since the question asks specifically whether a list of recipes appears after clicking the search tab, and the search screen would initially show search functionality rather than a pre-filtered recipe list, the answer is:

**No**",100.0

The first latest live drawing changes when you swipe right because that interaction causes different items in that horizontal scrollable section to appear - specifically moving from showing the ""old town alley"" image first to showing different content afterwards (like possibly showing more of what was previously off-screen from that particular viewport).

Wait...let me reconsider...

Actually looking more carefully at this question asking specifically about whether ""the first latest live drawing"" stays ""the same"", when one swipes right on that carousel/scrollable section - typically swiping right would move older/previous items into view from left side while current items slide off to right side...so yes technically speaking...

Hmm actually upon further reflection regarding typical carousel behavior when you swipe right - it typically brings previous items from left side into current view moving currently visible ones off to right...so first item would change...

My final answer remains:

Based on the current screenshot, I can see that we're looking at a list of math courses in the Khan Academy app. The visible items include various class levels from Class 9 through Class 12 math (India).

When we swipe up to ""Basic geometry and Measurement,"" we would be scrolling down the list, moving past ""Class 12 math (India)"" since that item appears earlier in the current view.

Looking at the current screen, I can see various notification-related settings like ""Show notifications"", ""Default"", ""Silent"", ""Pop on screen"", and ""Sound"". This appears to be a notification configuration screen.

When going back to the app from this notification settings screen, the user would likely return to the main app interface or a previous settings menu, not stay on notification-specific settings.

In the current state, neither option appears to be actively selected (both buttons appear in an unselected state with dark backgrounds).

The screen currently shows several artworks by Winston Smith from Jonathan LeVine Projects. When scrolling down in the ""Other works from Jonathan LeVine"" section, more artwork listings will be revealed. Based on the typical behavior of such interfaces, this scrolling action will display additional artworks below the currently visible ones.

Regarding whether the price for the ""Woman"" artwork will be shown on the screen after scrolling:

No",0.0
episode_15541/step_005.jpg,Scroll down to view more arts by Jonathan LeVine Projects.,"After scrolling down, did the artwork by Winston Smith still appear on the screen?",No,"The action taken was to scroll down to view more artworks by Jonathan LeVine Projects. After performing this scroll action, the screen would continue to display Winston Smith's artworks. Based on the content visible after scrolling, there are still multiple Winston Smith pieces shown, including:

- ""Butterfly"" (2002) - US$5,500
- ""Motel No-Tell"" (2001) - US$3,200  
- ""Punk Rock Bowling"" (2019) - US$3,000
- ""Big Brother Ain't Watchi..."" (partial title) - US$1,800

episode_10693/step_000.jpg,Open the BBC News app,"Does the BBC News app have a section labeled ""Top Stories""?",Yes,"Based on the action of opening the BBC News app, I need to analyze what will appear on the next screen.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see this is actually the Google News app, not BBC News. The question asks whether the BBC News app will have a section labeled ""Top Stories"" after opening it.

Since the action is to open the BBC News app (which is different from what's currently shown), the next screen would display the BBC News app interface. However, I cannot see the BBC News app interface in this screenshot to verify whether it has a ""Top Stories"" section.

Given that I can only see the current Google News interface and not the BBC News app that would appear after the action, I cannot definitively confirm the presence of a ""Top Stories"" section in the BBC News app from this image alone.

However, the question asks for a simple Yes or No answer about the next UI state after opening BBC News.

The current screen shows:
- A collection titled ""Sculpture Art"" 
- Status showing ""PRIVATE • 2 ITEMS""
- A sculpture image of a bust
- Delete and edit icons

When performing a ""go back"" action from a collection detail view, the next screen would typically show the previous screen in the navigation hierarchy - likely a list of collections or a gallery view showing multiple items rather than focusing on this single collection.

Therefore, the displayed content will change from showing this specific ""Sculpture Art"" collection detail to whatever screen was previously shown (likely a broader view of multiple collections or items).

**No**",100.0

After opening the BBC News app, the interface will display the BBC News app's color scheme, which typically features:
- White/light backgrounds
- Red BBC branding elements
- Black text on light backgrounds
- A significantly lighter overall color scheme

episode_5677/step_000.jpg,Open the CNN News app,Are there new notifications visible on the screen after the change?,No,"The question asks whether there are new notifications visible on the screen after opening the CNN News app.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see this is displaying what appears to be a Google article or web page about tracker alerts and Bluetooth tracking, not the CNN News app interface.

Since the action is to ""Open the CNN News app,"" the next screen would be the CNN News app interface, which would be a completely different view from the current Google-related content shown.

Without being able to see what the actual CNN News app screen will look like after opening it, and based solely on what's shown in this current screenshot (which is not the CNN News app yet), I cannot determine if there will be new notifications visible in the next state.

However, the question is asking specifically about the ""next UI state"" after the action is performed. Since we're currently not in the CNN News app, and the action is to open it, the next screen would show the CNN News app interface. Typically, when opening a news app, there may or may not be notifications visible depending on the app's design and notification settings.

However, the current screenshot shows what appears to be a Google or Android-related article or webpage, not the CNN News app interface. The action states ""Open the CNN News app"" but the screenshot doesn't show the CNN News app.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see:
- A news article about Google's tracker detection features
- Content discussing Bluetooth tracking networks, AirTags, and Unknown Tracker Alerts
- A video player showing Android-related content
- The status bar showing 12:39 with various system icons

The question asks: ""Is the CNN News app open after the change?""

If the action to ""Open the CNN News app"" is performed, the screen would transition from the current view (which appears to be showing tech news, possibly from a different source or browser) to the CNN News app interface. After the action is completed, the CNN News app would indeed be open and displayed on the screen.

Since there is no original price currently visible on the screen (only the auction starting bid), scrolling up would not reveal an original price because one doesn't appear to exist in this listing.

Looking at the current screen, I can see ""CAMPUS KING PLUS Casuals"" is visible in the second position of the product grid at the top right.

When scrolling up on a mobile interface, content moves upward, which means items currently at the bottom of the screen will move into view, while items at the top (like ""CAMPUS KING PLUS Casuals"") will move upward and potentially off the screen.

Therefore, after scrolling up, ""CAMPUS KING PLUS Casuals"" will likely no longer be visible on the screen.

The screen shows several paragraphs of text discussing business matters involving people named Hyde, Steve Wynn, and Donald, with discussion of hotel operations and financial figures.

However, this does not appear to be the Wattpad app interface. There are no browsing tags, navigation menus, story categories, or other typical Wattpad UI elements visible on this screen. This looks like a plain text reading interface.

When clicking on a calendar widget, it typically opens an interface where you can select or change dates.

After scrolling up on this eBay item listing page, the core information about the item would remain the same. The starting bid amount is a fixed value set by the seller and would not change simply from scrolling the page up or down. Scrolling would only reveal different parts of the listing (like more product details, description, shipping info, etc.), but the actual bid price of $29.99 would stay constant.

Looking at the current screen, I can see ""8:40"" displayed at the top of the interface near various status icons. When a user performs a swipe up action on this type of interface, they are typically scrolling down through content, which would move the current view upward and bring new content from below into view.

Since the time display at ""8:40"" appears to be part of the device's status bar or the app's header section, and swiping up would scroll the content area below it, the time display should remain visible in its fixed position at the top of the screen.

After going back, the user would return to the previous screen, which would likely be:
- A list/feed of multiple podcast episodes from ""The Daily"" podcast, or
- A general podcasts browsing screen with multiple podcast options

Since going back from a detailed single-item view typically returns to a list or collection view with multiple items, there would indeed be more options available on the next screen.

At the bottom is a Google search bar with Google Lens and camera shortcuts.

When opening the Kitchen Stories app from this screen, the display will transition to show the Kitchen Stories app interface instead of the home screen. This means the app icons currently visible (Maps, Play Store, Gmail, Photos, YouTube, etc.) will no longer be displayed as the Kitchen Stories app takes over the full screen.

episode_15966/step_008.jpg,swipe up ,"Was the ""Add Plant"" button visible before the swipe?",Yes,"Based on the screenshot and the swipe up action described, I need to determine if the ""Add Plant"" button was visible before the swipe occurred.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the ""Add Plant"" button is visible at the bottom of the screen in a turquoise/green color. 

Since the action is a ""swipe up"" action, this typically means scrolling the content upward to reveal content that was below the current view. After a swipe up action, new content from below would appear, and content currently at the top would move up and potentially off-screen.

The question asks if the ""Add Plant"" button was visible BEFORE the swipe. Since the button is currently visible at the bottom of the screen in this screenshot (which represents the state before the swipe action is performed), the answer is:

Looking at the current UI, I can see:
- A calendar interface for selecting dates
- Date range selected: Wed, Oct 11 to Mon, Oct 16
- A blue ""Done"" button at the bottom

After clicking the ""Done"" button, the calendar selection will be confirmed and the UI will likely return to a previous screen or search interface. However, based on the context of a date selection flow, the next screen would typically show the search results or return to the main booking interface - not necessarily introduce a new ""Recent Searches"" section.

episode_2471/step_002.jpg,Scroll up,"In the after image, does the contact ""E"" appear above contact ""F""?",Yes,"The action described is scrolling up in a contacts list. In the current image, I can see contacts listed alphabetically with letters A through K visible. When scrolling up in a contacts list, earlier entries (those higher in the alphabet) will move down on the screen, and later entries (those lower in the alphabet) will move up and become visible.

Since the question asks whether contact ""E"" appears above contact ""F"" in the after image (after scrolling up), I need to consider the alphabetical order. In any alphabetically sorted contacts list, ""E"" naturally comes before ""F"" in the alphabet, so ""E"" would appear above ""F"" regardless of scrolling position, as long as both are visible.

After scrolling up, both E and F should still be visible (since we're moving later contacts into view), and E would still appear above F due to alphabetical ordering.

- A ""Light"" header with a sun icon
- ""Indirect Sun"" subsection with ""Recommended"" label
- Explanatory text about indirect sun
- An illustration showing sun and plant with ""5 ft"" measurement
- ""Light"" label with ""Bright Indirect"" text

Since a swipe up action typically scrolls content upward (moving it off the top of the screen), the light section information at the top would move up and potentially disappear from view as lower content (like the Temperature section) moves up to take its place.

When a user swipes up to view more details, the screen will scroll upward, moving the artwork image further up and potentially off the top of the visible area. This scrolling action would reveal more information that currently exists below the fold (not visible in the current view), such as additional artwork details, descriptions, or related works.

The action is to click on one of these screenshot files. This would typically open the file for viewing rather than changing the list of recent files displayed. Opening a file doesn't add new files to or remove files from the recent files list - it simply accesses an existing file.

episode_13217/step_004.jpg,Click on the screenshot file on the screen.,Did the file list refresh after clicking on the screenshot file?,No,"Based on the action described - clicking on a screenshot file on the screen - I need to consider what changes would occur in a file manager or file browsing interface.

When clicking on a file in a file manager application, the typical behavior is to either:
1. Open the file in a viewer/editor
2. Display file details or options
3. Navigate to a different screen

The question asks specifically if the file list refreshed after this action. A ""refresh"" would mean the list of files is reloaded and redisplayed, typically to show any changes in the files.

Simply clicking on a single file to view it or open it would NOT cause the file list to refresh. The file list would only refresh if:
- A pull-to-refresh gesture was performed
- A refresh button was pressed
- Files were added/deleted/modified and the list auto-updated
- The user navigated away and back to the file list

episode_11848/step_001.jpg,Go back to the previous screen,"Is the ""Buy Now"" button visible in both screens?",Yes,"The action ""Go back to the previous screen"" will navigate from the current product details screen back to the previous screen in the browsing history.

After performing this action, the user will return to whichever screen they were viewing before accessing this product page. This could be a product listing, category page, search results, or another screen depending on their navigation path.

Regarding the question about the ""Buy Now"" button visibility:

**No**

The ""Buy Now"" button is visible on the current screen (as shown in the bottom section of the product details page), but it will not be visible after going back to the previous screen, as the previous screen likely shows a different view (such as a product listing or category page) that does not display this specific product's purchase buttons.

episode_318/step_001.jpg,scroll up to read more about moon phase.,Did the azimuth angle increase after scrolling?,Yes,"Based on the action description ""scroll up to read more about moon phase,"" I need to determine if the azimuth angle increased after this scrolling action.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the azimuth value is displayed as ""86.33° E"" in the More Information section.

When scrolling up to read more about moon phase information, we would typically be viewing earlier content or refreshing the data. However, the azimuth angle is a real-time astronomical value that changes based on the moon's position in the sky relative to the observer's location. 

Since the question asks specifically about whether the azimuth angle **increased after scrolling**, and scrolling is simply a navigation action that doesn't inherently cause time to pass or the moon's position to change significantly, the azimuth value would likely remain the same or could even decrease depending on the actual time elapsed and moon's movement.

Without being able to see the ""next"" screen state after the scroll action, and understanding that scrolling itself doesn't cause astronomical values to increase, the answer is:

**No**",0.0

When the user performs a swipe up action, the content will scroll upward, meaning earlier items in the list will move up and eventually off the screen, while items lower in the list will come into view.

Since the Britannia Jimjam Sandwich Biscuits is already near the top of the current view, swiping up will likely cause this item to scroll off the screen or at least move upward.

When swiping right to left, products would shift - the VDIX table would move off screen to the left, and new products would appear from the right (including the Royal Handicrafts stool that was previously off-screen).

Since the VDIX Solid Wood Side Table would no longer be visible after the swipe (it would be pushed off to the left side), the question about whether its finish color ""remains brown"" doesn't really apply in the traditional sense - the product itself would not be visible on the next screen.

However, if the question is asking whether the product's attribute (finish color) changes as a result of the swipe action, the answer would be that the product's inherent properties don't change - only its visibility changes.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see ""Marc Santora"" appears near the top portion of the visible content, with biographical information about him. 

When scrolling up in an article, content moves downward on the screen, revealing earlier content from above. This means the current visible content (including ""Marc Santora"") would move down and potentially off the bottom of the screen, while content from earlier in the article would appear at the top.

Since ""Marc Santora"" appears to be author/byline information that's likely positioned early in the article, and scrolling up would reveal content from even earlier in the article, the ""Marc Santora"" section would likely move down but could still remain visible on the screen depending on how much scrolling occurs.

However, given that a scroll action typically moves a significant portion of content, and ""Marc Santora"" is already partway down the current view, it's likely that after scrolling up, this section would either be at the very bottom of the screen or would have scrolled off the bottom edge.

Looking at the UI elements that would typically change when a video starts playing on a TED talk page, I need to determine if additional views/interface elements will appear after clicking the play button.

When a TED video starts playing, the typical behavior is that video player controls, timeline, quality settings, and other playback-related UI elements become visible. However, the question specifically asks about ""more views displayed"" - meaning whether additional viewing statistics or metrics appear.

The answer is: **No**

This implies changing the setting from ""Notify once"" to a different option that would notify for every message, rather than just once.

The action is simply selecting a different sampling rate (32kHz). This is a basic audio quality setting that determines the number of samples per second for recording.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see this is a Settings screen showing audio recording settings (AAC format, Microphone, Sampling rate, Encoder bitrate, Audio track, and Advanced options), but there is no visible ""Keep screen on"" option displayed in this view.

Since the ""Keep screen on"" option is not visible on the current screen and changing the sampling rate would only affect that specific setting without modifying other unrelated settings, the ""Keep screen on"" option would maintain its current state (whether enabled or disabled).

episode_18875/step_005.jpg,Swipe down the circle icon,Is the icon for notes visible on the bottom menu after the swipe?,Yes,"Looking at this GUI interaction, I need to analyze what happens when swiping down the circle icon in a presentation editing interface.

- Bottom menu bar with ""Notes"" and ""Comments"" buttons visible

When you ""swipe down the circle icon"" (which appears to be the circular refresh/rotation icon at the top of the selected image), this action would typically rotate or manipulate the selected image.

After this action, the bottom menu structure would remain the same, as swiping/rotating an image doesn't change the fundamental UI layout of the application. The Notes icon would still be visible in the bottom menu.

episode_15843/step_001.jpg,Go back,Is there a new headline present after performing the action?,Yes,"The action ""Go back"" will return you from the search interface to the previous screen. Based on standard app navigation patterns, when you go back from a search screen, you typically return to the main content view.

Since the question asks if there will be a new headline present after performing the ""Go back"" action, the answer depends on whether returning to the previous screen would show headlines that weren't visible on the current search screen.

Looking at the current screen, we see a search interface with recent searches listed (""paramedic news"" and ""knoxville news""), but no actual news headlines are displayed. Going back would likely return to a news feed or main screen that would contain news headlines.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Yes**

When the user scrolls down on this PENUP app interface, the following changes will occur:

1. The top horizontal scrollable row of content will move upward or potentially scroll out of view
2. More content from the ""Popular this week"" section will become visible
3. The ""Coloring pages people like"" section will move up on the screen
4. Additional content sections below may come into view

However, the status bar at the very top of the screen (showing 9:11, battery, signal, etc.) will remain fixed in place, as it is part of the device's system UI, not the scrollable app content.

Looking at the current screen, I can see at the top there is a rating display showing ""0 out of 5 stars"" with empty star icons and a ""WRITE A REVIEW"" button.

Since the question asks about whether the rating was shown in the ""before image"" (the previous page), and we're currently looking at a product details page that does display the rating, the answer would be:

**After the swipe:**
The detailed list displays buses **12, 2, 12, 12** (multiple instances of bus 12, and bus 2)

Since the first image shows buses 12, 2, and 33, while the second image shows buses 12, 2, and additional instances of 12 (but no 33 visible in the detailed list), the bus numbers are not the same.

Looking at the current screen which shows a star map with various celestial objects labeled (Neptune, ADEOS II, STARLINK satellites, SCULPTOR constellation, FORNAX constellation, and Koronas-Foton), clicking on Neptune would likely select or focus on that celestial object.

However, looking at the information displayed about the journey to Lavender Stn Exit A/ICA, the estimated time remains unchanged. 

Before the swipe: The screen shows ""Walk to Lavender Stn Exit A/ICA"" with ""1 min"" displayed.

After the swipe-up action: While the action reveals additional details (like the bus stop number), the estimated walking time to reach Lavender Stn Exit A/ICA remains the same at 1 minute. This is because the swipe-up is simply revealing more information about the route, not changing the actual travel conditions or route itself.

After swiping up on the screen, the view will scroll upward, showing more filter options that are currently below the visible area.

However, this screenshot does not show a Categories dropdown menu - it shows an accounts selection interface. Without being able to see what the actual Categories dropdown contains or where it's located in this interface, I cannot definitively determine the next UI state.

That said, based on typical UI patterns, when clicking a dropdown menu, the original trigger element usually remains visible while additional options appear below or around it. If ""All"" is the default or first option in a Categories dropdown, it would likely remain visible.

episode_1082/step_013.jpg,Swipe up to view more style inspiration,"Is the message ""Wear a sense of quality in your daily life."" still visible after the swipe?",No,"Based on the action of swiping up to view more style inspiration, the next screen will show the page content scrolling upward, revealing new content from below. 

Looking at the current screen, I can see the message ""Wear a sense of quality in your daily life."" is displayed prominently in the middle section of the page. After performing the swipe up action, this message will move upward along with the rest of the content, eventually scrolling out of view as new content from below enters the visible area.

Therefore, the answer to whether ""Wear a sense of quality in your daily life."" is still visible after the swipe is:

episode_11217/step_001.jpg,Swipe up on the screen,Is “Eligible for Pay On Delivery” still visible after the swipe up?,Yes,"The question asks whether ""Eligible for Pay On Delivery"" will still be visible after swiping up on the screen.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a filters panel showing ""Prime & Delivery"" options. Under ""Shipping Options"", there is a button labeled ""Eligible for Pay On Delivery"". 

When a user swipes up on this screen, the content would scroll upward, revealing content that is currently below the visible area. This means the ""Eligible for Pay On Delivery"" option, which is currently near the top of the visible content area, would likely scroll up and out of view as new content from below becomes visible.

Therefore, after swiping up, ""Eligible for Pay On Delivery"" would no longer be visible on the screen.

No",0.0
episode_17628/step_001.jpg,Swipe up on the screen,"Was ""Offline reading"" status changed to ""OFF"" after the swipe?",No,"Based on the action described (swiping up on the screen) and analyzing the current screenshot, I can see that the ""Offline reading"" option currently shows ""ON"" status at the bottom of the visible screen. However, a simple swipe up action is just a scrolling gesture that would reveal more menu options below - it would not toggle any settings.

Since the action is only scrolling and not tapping on the ""Offline reading"" toggle itself, the status will remain unchanged.

No",100.0
episode_1082/step_013.jpg,Swipe up to view more style inspiration,"Did the category title change from ""Shirts & Blouses"" to ""T-Shirts & Polo Shirts"" after the swipe?",Yes,"Looking at the current screen and the action of swiping up to view more style inspiration, I can analyze the before and after states:

**Current state:** The screen shows ""Shirts & Blouses"" as the category title, featuring a Rayon Blouse with the tagline ""Wear a sense of quality in your daily life.""

**After swiping up:** The next screen would show different style inspiration content, potentially including a different category section that may display ""T-Shirts & Polo Shirts"" as the new category title being viewed.

Given that swiping up typically scrolls through content and reveals new sections in a carousel or feed format, and considering the presence of pagination dots indicating multiple style sections, the category title would likely change to show the next category in the style inspiration sequence.

episode_8914/step_000.jpg,Open the Guardian news app,Are there visible news articles displayed after the action?,No,"Based on the action of opening the Guardian news app, I can analyze what will appear on the next screen.

However, looking at the current screenshot, I can see this is actually already showing the New York Times app with search results for ""Ukrain News"" (note the typo). The screen displays several news articles about Ukraine including:
- ""Ukrainian Troops Trained by the West Stumble in Battle""
- ""Amid the Counterattack's Deadly Slog, a Glimmer of Success for Ukraine""
- ""Extensive Minefields Impede Ukraine's Counteroffensive, Military Analysts Say""

Since the action requests opening the Guardian news app, but we're currently in the NYT app, this would likely switch to a different app entirely.

When you swipe up on this type of scrollable settings page, the content scrolls upward to reveal more options below, but the existing options that are already visible (like ""Change Language"") remain unchanged in their text and settings.

Opening the Guardian news app would be switching to a completely different application. Since the question asks about notifications displayed on the screen after the action, and the Guardian app would show its own interface (likely its home screen or last viewed page), the answer depends on whether the Guardian app has any notifications to display.

Without being able to see what the Guardian app interface looks like after opening it, and based on typical app behavior where news apps don't automatically show notification banners on their main interface, the answer is:

No",100.0
episode_2269/step_014.jpg,Click on the drop down of the Categories,Has the time on the screen changed after the action?,Yes,"The user has asked about the next UI state after clicking on a ""Categories"" dropdown, and specifically whether the time on screen will change.

Looking at the current screen, I can see it shows ""4:14"" in the top left corner. The screen is showing a ""Select accounts"" page with ""All"" selected and ""Cash"" account visible.

However, the action mentioned is clicking on a dropdown for ""Categories,"" but I don't see any Categories dropdown or button visible on this current screen. This appears to be an accounts selection screen, not a categories selection screen.

After such an action (even though the element isn't clearly visible in the current UI), the only likely change to the time would be if enough real time passes during the interaction. Since UI interactions typically happen quickly (within seconds), and the time shown is at the minute level (4:14), it's unlikely that a full minute would pass just from clicking a dropdown.

Based on this analysis, the time on screen would not change just from the action of clicking a dropdown menu.

Based on typical scrolling behavior, scrolling up would shift the content downward, revealing items that are currently above the visible area while pushing some current items (particularly those at the bottom like ""ROSE"") out of view at the bottom of the screen.

The current screen shows a white/light background for the article content area with a blue header bar at the top.

The Google News app typically has a white background with a white/light colored interface.

However, since these are two different applications with different visual designs and layouts, the specific background styling would differ even if both use predominantly white/light backgrounds. The UN News article page shown has its own specific design scheme, while Google News has its distinct interface design.

There is no visible DeviantArt app interface yet since the action is just being performed.

Based on the question ""Is the user currently viewing a list of deviations from artists?"", which asks about the NEXT UI state after opening the DeviantArt app, I would need to consider what typically appears when DeviantArt first opens. DeviantArt commonly shows a feed or list of artwork/deviations from various artists on its main screen.

However, since the question asks about the state that ""will appear"" and we're still at the home screen, I cannot definitively confirm whether the next screen will show a list of deviations without seeing the actual DeviantArt interface.

When the action ""Open the PowerPoint app"" is performed from this state, it would likely:
1. Either do nothing (since we're already in PowerPoint)

The element consists of the text 'NEW' followed by a gear icon. The text is in a light gray color, using a sans-serif font, and is positioned to the left of the icon. The gear icon is small and dark, indicating settings or options. The element is visually distinct due to its compact size and the combination of text and icon.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the ratings section at the bottom showing several circular metrics including ""Value for Money"" with a rating of 4.3.

When swiping left to view more similar products (as shown in the horizontal product carousel), this action only affects the product listings displayed in the ""Similar Products"" section at the top of the screen. The ""Ratings & Reviews"" section below, which contains the ""Value for Money"" rating, is independent of the product carousel.

Therefore, swiping left on the similar products carousel will not affect the ratings section, and the ""Value for Money"" rating will remain at 4.3.

Looking at the current interface, I can see this is a Behance search results page showing various project thumbnails. At the bottom of the screen, there is a blue button labeled ""Projects"" with a downward-facing chevron icon, indicating it's a drop-down menu.

When clicked, this button would expand to show filtering options. Based on typical UI patterns for Behance and similar platforms, the drop-down menu would likely contain options such as:
- Projects (which would be the first/default option)
- For You
- Following
- And potentially other filtering categories

Therefore, to answer the question ""Is the 'Projects' option the first item in the drop-down menu?"":

**Yes**",100.0
episode_16979/step_006.jpg,Click on the first suggestion.,Is there a rating visible for the recipe after selecting the first suggestion?,Yes,"Based on the current screenshot, I can see a search interface with a text input field containing ""vegan spinach and mushroom lasagna"" and a single search suggestion showing ""Vegan spinach and mushroom lasagna"" with ""Recipe"" labeled underneath.

Looking at the action to click on the first suggestion and examining what information is currently visible, I need to determine if a rating will be shown on the next screen after selecting this suggestion.

From the current interface, I can only see the recipe name and that it's categorized as a ""Recipe,"" but there is no rating information visible yet. However, the question asks about what will appear AFTER performing the action of clicking the first suggestion.

Since I cannot see into the future state or what the next screen will display, I can only make an assessment based on typical recipe app behavior. Usually, when you click on a recipe suggestion, it takes you to a detailed recipe page which commonly includes ratings.

However, I need to be careful - the question specifically asks if there IS a rating visible, not if there MIGHT be one. Without being able to see the actual next state, I cannot definitively confirm a rating will be present.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see three similar products displayed in a horizontal scrollable view. The middle product has a ""Bestseller"" badge/label on it (visible on the Suncrown Furniture product). When swiping left, the view would shift to reveal products that are currently on the right side of the scroll.

Since we can already see a ""Bestseller"" labeled product in the current view (the middle item), and we're asking about what appears after swiping left to see more products, the answer depends on whether any NEW products that come into view also have this label.

From what's visible, swiping left would bring the sponsored Wakeup India product more into view and potentially reveal additional products on the right. However, based on the current screenshot, I cannot confirm that any new products coming into view would have the ""BESTSELLER"" label.

Looking at the image, I can see the ""Latest live drawings"" section with multiple drawing thumbnails. Some of these thumbnails have timers displayed on them (visible in the bottom corners).

When you swipe right on a carousel or horizontal scrolling list like ""Latest live drawings,"" new items typically slide in from the right side while existing items move to the left. This reveals different live drawing items that were previously off-screen.

Since swiping right brings in different live drawing items with their own independent timers, the timer values would be different from the previous items. The timer value on a newly revealed drawing could be longer, shorter, or the same as what was previously visible - it depends entirely on when that particular drawing session started.

However, the existing timers on drawings that were already visible would continue counting up (getting longer) as time passes during the swipe action itself.

Given that at least some timers would increment during the swipe animation and transition:

When you swipe up on a scrollable interface like this, the content will shift upward. The current view shows an ""Arrival updates"" button in the upper portion of the screen. After swiping up, the content will scroll such that:

3. Additional details below the current view will become visible

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a ""Cancel"" button in the top-right corner of the screen. The action is ""Swipe down"" which typically reveals or refreshes content on mobile interfaces.

Based on standard mobile UI behavior, a swipe down gesture on a search/browse screen like this would likely:
- Either refresh the current content
- Or potentially close/dismiss the current view

However, the ""Cancel"" button appears to be part of the top navigation bar associated with the search interface. Since this is a search results page showing artists matching ""Solomon Hart"", a swipe down would most likely just scroll through the results or attempt to refresh them, but would not dismiss the search interface itself.

The ""Cancel"" button would remain visible as it's part of the persistent search UI header.

Without seeing the actual next screen in the image provided, but understanding typical e-commerce product pages, the answer to whether the item would still be displayed as eligible for free shipping would depend on what was shown on the product details page before navigating to reviews.

However, examining the current screenshot, I can see ""Popular today"" is already visible at the bottom of the screen, but the actual content of that section would need to be viewed by scrolling. Since the question asks about the state ""after scrolling down,"" and without being able to see what content appears in the Popular today section after the scroll action is completed, I cannot definitively confirm whether ""Hyun"" appears there.

But given that the action specifically mentions looking for art by ""Hayun"" (not ""Hyun"") and the question asks about ""Hyun"" (a slightly different name), this suggests these may be different artists or there may be a name variation.

When swiping up on this type of news feed interface, the typical behavior is to scroll down through the content within the same section, revealing more articles that are below the currently visible ones. The section header ""Business"" would typically remain at the top as the content scrolls underneath it, or it might scroll away but the user would still be within the Business section viewing additional Business articles.

Since the action is specifically about viewing ""different articles"" (not changing sections), and we're currently in the Business section, the swipe up action would simply scroll to show more Business articles that are further down in the feed.

The action involves typing text into the search field, which would trigger location suggestions to appear. However, regarding the specific question about whether the time changes from 11:25 to 11:26:

No

episode_586/step_002.jpg,Go back to the previous page,Are there different categories shown in the bottom menu of both images?,Yes,"Looking at the action described (going back to the previous page), I need to determine if the bottom menu categories would differ between the current ""Tech & Gaming"" category view and the previous page (which would likely be the main categories view).

When viewing the ""Tech & Gaming"" category, the bottom menu would show subcategories or related options specific to Tech & Gaming content.

When going back to the previous page (the main categories page), the bottom menu would show the main category options like ""Featured,"" ""Categories,"" ""Search,"" etc.

- In the current screenshot, the time shows 10:44

- The current view shows various products including shoes (Zion 3 PF, Air Jordan 1 Low, Jordan One Take 4 PF, Jordan Max Aura 5) and what appears to be clothing items at the bottom

The action is simply ""Swipe up to view more products"" - this is a scrolling action, not a tab selection action. Swiping up would just scroll down to show more products in the current ""All"" category view, not switch to showing only shoes.

episode_15843/step_009.jpg,Swipe up,"After the swipe up, does the word ""Sections"" appear in bold at the top of the menu?",Yes,"The screenshot shows a USA Today Sports mobile app interface. The main content area is currently displaying what appears to be a loading screen with a spinner icon in the center. At the top of the screen, there is a navigation bar with tabs for different sports sections including MLB, NBA, NHL, Golfweek, and College Basketball (M).

At the bottom of the screen is a navigation bar with five options:
- Top Stories (speaker icon)
- For You (thumbs up icon)
- Sections (menu icon) - currently highlighted
- eNewspaper (newspaper icon)
- Puzzles (grid icon)

Based on the question asking about whether ""Sections"" appears in bold at the top of the menu after a swipe up action, I need to analyze what would happen when swiping up from this current state.

Looking at the current UI, ""Sections"" is already visible in the bottom navigation bar and appears to be the selected/active tab. After performing a swipe up action on this screen, the interface would likely display the Sections menu content area above the bottom navigation.

3. There's a ""Sample files"" section visible in the background

The action of renaming a file (changing its name to ""Skill Training"") is simply a file management operation that changes the name of an existing file. It does not:
- Create new files
- Add files to the display
- Change which files are shown in the sample files section

The number of sample files displayed depends on what sample files exist in the system, not on renaming operations. Renaming a file only changes its name, not the total count of files displayed.

- The keyboard is displayed at the bottom for text input
- There are ""Cancel"" and ""OK"" buttons to confirm or cancel the action

- The rename dialog will close
- The file list will update to show the new filename
- The user will return to the main file browsing view

**Answer to the Question:**
Is the file name still ""PPT on management training.dotx"" after the change?

**No**
