The keyboard at the bottom is in dark mode, but the main interface area is light.

When clicking on the first suggestion ""Rotterdam Netherlands"", this will likely select that location and either close the suggestions dropdown or navigate to a results page. Based on typical UI behavior for travel/location apps, the main interface would remain consistent with the current light mode theme.

When the ""LOG IN"" button is clicked, this will typically navigate to a login/sign-in page that would contain various authentication options.

Based on the typical behavior of mobile apps when transitioning from a login prompt to a full login screen, there would likely be multiple sign-in options presented, including social media login options like Facebook.

However, this appears to be a summary view.

There is no visible cross/X button at the top left corner of the screen - the top left only shows the number ""4"" which appears to be a tab indicator.

However, if we assume there is a cross button that would close this app page and return to a previous screen (like the main Play Store or search results), clicking it would likely take the user away from the Bing app's individual page entirely.

When scrolling up to view more articles, the screen content will move upward, revealing articles that were previously above the current view. This scrolling action will likely cause the current Aquaguard advertisement to move down and potentially out of view, while new content (and potentially different advertisements) from the upper portion of the page will become visible.

episode_904/step_003.jpg,Click on the first suggestion.,"After clicking on the first suggestion, is the search button still labeled ""Search Omio""?",Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a departure search interface with ""Rotterdam"" typed in the search field and several Rotterdam location suggestions listed below. There's also a keyboard visible at the bottom.

When the first suggestion ""Rotterdam Netherlands"" is clicked, the app will populate the departure field with this selection and likely return to the main search interface. Based on typical mobile app behavior, once a departure location is selected, the interface would show the search functionality again.

Since this appears to be the Omio travel app (based on the UI design and functionality), after selecting the departure location, the search button would still maintain its ""Search Omio"" label as this is the standard branding for their search functionality.

No",0.0
episode_2471/step_002.jpg,Scroll up,"Is contact ""K"" present in both images?",Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a contacts list with alphabetical entries from A through K visible. The contact ""K"" is clearly present at the bottom of the current view.

When scrolling up, the screen will move upward, showing contacts that come earlier in the alphabet (before ""A"" or any contacts at the very beginning of the list). This means contacts A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K will scroll down and potentially move out of the visible area, being replaced by contacts that appear earlier in the alphabetical order.

Since ""K"" is currently at the bottom of the visible area and scrolling up will bring earlier contacts into view, ""K"" will likely disappear from the screen after the scroll action.

There's a ""View all"" link on the right side of this section.

When clicking on the ""View all"" tab, this action would typically expand or navigate to show more tools/apps within the pregnancy category, rather than displaying different categories like ""Utilities."" The ""View all"" appears to be specifically for viewing all pregnancy-related tools, not for browsing different app categories.

There's also a cross/X button in the top left corner.

When clicking the cross at the top left corner, this will typically close the current app detail page and return to the previous screen (likely the main Play Store interface or search results). This navigation action will remove the current Bing app detail page from view.

When clicking on this ""View all"" tab, it will expand or navigate to show more tools within the pregnancy category. Based on the current content which is focused on pregnancy tools (not baby tools), and the fact that this appears to be specifically a pregnancy tools section, the expanded view would likely show more pregnancy-related tools rather than baby tools.

When the action ""Enter urban art in the searchbox"" is performed, this will trigger a search query. The search results will replace the current content below the search box, showing results specifically related to ""urban art"" instead of the current ""Trending Artists"" section and ""Artsy Collections"" section.

The layout structure will change from showing trending artists and collections to displaying search results relevant to urban art.

episode_15703/step_001.jpg,Click on the edit option,Is there a note about changing the date and time picker in the new screen?,Yes,"To answer this question, I need to analyze what happens when clicking on the ""Edit"" option shown in the current screen.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a tasks/calendar app with various scheduled items. At the bottom of the screen, there are action buttons including ""Complete"", ""Edit"", ""Share"", and ""Delete"". The user is clicking on the ""Edit"" option.

When clicking ""Edit"" on a calendar/task item, this would typically open an edit screen where the user can modify the details of that specific task or event. This edit screen would likely contain form fields for editing various properties like the title, description, date, time, location, etc.

However, I cannot see what the actual edit screen looks like from this current screenshot, as it shows the state before the action is performed. The question asks specifically about whether there will be ""a note about changing the date and time picker"" in the new screen that appears after clicking edit.

Without being able to see the edit screen that will appear, I cannot definitively determine if there will be a note about changing the date and time picker.

Without being able to see the actual AccuWeather app interface that would appear after opening it, I cannot determine if there would be a precipitation notification present.

When scrolling down to see more product details, the ""Add to cart"" button would likely remain visible as it's typically a fixed element at the bottom of product pages for easy access. Therefore, the answer is:

Yes",100.0

At the bottom, there's an ""All Time"" section that also displays ""Total: 1h 28m"".

When swiping up to view All time data, the interface will scroll down to reveal more of the All Time section content. Since both the current ""All"" tab view and the ""All Time"" section at the bottom show the same total time of ""1h 28m"", the total time displayed will remain the same.

episode_18306/step_002.jpg,Enter urban art in the searchbox,Did the recent searches section disappear after entering the search term?,Yes,"Looking at the current GUI screenshot, I can see a search interface with:
- A search box at the top with placeholder text ""Search artists, artworks, galleries, etc""
- A ""Recent Searches"" section below it showing ""We'll save your recent searches here""
- A ""Trending Artists"" section with artist profiles
- An ""Artsy Collections"" section at the bottom
- A keyboard is visible at the bottom of the screen

When the action ""Enter urban art in the searchbox"" is performed, the text ""urban art"" will be typed into the search field. This will likely trigger search suggestions or results to appear, which would replace the current content below the search box.

Since search interfaces typically hide recent searches and other sections when displaying active search results or suggestions, the ""Recent Searches"" section that currently shows ""We'll save your recent searches here"" will disappear to make room for the search results.

The action described is to click on an icon in the middle right of the screen.

In the middle right area, I can see what appears to be a heart/wishlist icon and a shopping bag icon. Clicking on either of these icons would likely either add the item to wishlist/favorites or navigate to a shopping bag/cart view, but would not change the product image itself.

Since the action is just clicking an interface element rather than navigating to a different product or color variant, the same product image with the model wearing the same orange t-shirt would remain displayed.

The action described is to ""Click on the icon in the middle right of the screen.""

However, the icons in the middle right area of the screen appear to be product-related actions like share, favorite, and what looks like a folder or collection icon - not the notification icon itself. Clicking on these product action icons would not affect the notification count in the status bar.

The notification icon showing ""1"" would only change if the actual notification itself were addressed (like opening the notification panel and clearing notifications), not by clicking on unrelated product interface elements.

The action described is to ""Click on the icon in the middle right of the screen.""

In the middle right area of the screen, I can see what appears to be a heart/favorite icon. Clicking on this icon would typically add the item to a wishlist or favorites, but would not introduce a ""You May Also Like"" section to the current product page.

Such recommendation sections usually appear when scrolling down on product pages or after adding items to cart, not when clicking the favorite/heart icon.

At the bottom of the screen, there are action buttons including ""Complete"", ""Edit"", ""Share"", and ""Delete"".

When the ""Edit"" option is clicked, it will open an editing interface for the selected task item. Based on the typical functionality of task/calendar editing screens, this would likely include options to modify various aspects of the task such as time, duration, recurrence, etc.

Given that this appears to be a time-based scheduling application and the edit function would typically provide options to adjust temporal aspects of tasks, an ""Add more time"" option would be a logical feature to include in the editing interface.

The action described is ""Select circled T next to M for tuesday,"" which means the user will tap on the Tuesday button.

The action is to click on an icon in the middle right of the screen.

In the middle right area, I can see what appears to be a heart/wishlist icon. Clicking on this icon would typically add the item to a wishlist or favorites list, which usually results in a brief confirmation message or visual feedback (like the heart filling in), but would not display additional purchase offers related to buying two items.

In the current screen, I can see a battery icon in the top-right corner of the status bar (showing what appears to be a battery with charging indicator).

When performing a ""Go back to previous page"" action, the user would typically return to a previous screen in the app or to the home screen. In most cases, the status bar (which contains the battery icon) remains visible across different screens within the same app or when navigating between apps.

Since the battery icon is part of the system status bar and status bars are typically persistent across most screens in mobile interfaces, the battery icon would likely remain visible on the previous page as well.

The action described is ""Select circled T next to M for tuesday"" - this refers to selecting the Tuesday day option in the weekly schedule selector. This action would simply add Tuesday to the days when this alarm will repeat.

Since selecting a day of the week for alarm repetition does not affect alarm settings like vibrate, sound, or other preferences, the vibrate option will remain in its current enabled state after this action.

episode_20055/step_008.jpg,Select circled T next to M for tuesday,"Is the alarm still set for 5 days, 13 hours, and 2 minutes in the after state?",Yes,"Looking at the current screen, I can see an alarm set for 8:00 AM on Monday, with the status showing ""Alarm set for 5 days, 13 hours, and 2 minutes from now.""

The action is to select the circled T (Tuesday) next to the already selected M (Monday). This will add Tuesday to the alarm schedule, changing it from a Monday-only alarm to a Monday-Tuesday alarm.

When Tuesday is added to the alarm schedule, the alarm will now occur more frequently (both Monday and Tuesday instead of just Monday). This means the next occurrence of the alarm will be sooner than the original Monday-only schedule, which will change the countdown time.

Since adding Tuesday to the schedule will make the alarm occur more frequently and potentially sooner, the countdown time of ""5 days, 13 hours, and 2 minutes"" will change.

When you swipe up to learn more about Romanticism art, the screen will scroll upward to reveal more content about the Romanticism art movement. This scrolling action will likely cause the advertisement to either:
1. Remain in the same position at the bottom
2. Be replaced by a different advertisement
3. Move or change in some way

Since I cannot see what the next screen will look like after the swipe action, and advertisements on mobile apps often rotate or change when users interact with the interface, I cannot definitively determine if the same advertisement will remain.

When a swipe down action is performed on this type of mobile interface, it typically reveals more content below or refreshes the page content.

Given that there are already similar products visible at the bottom and Q&A sections above, a swipe down would likely show additional content, more product recommendations, or different sections of the product page that aren't currently visible.

Since this would introduce new content sections or significantly alter what's visible on screen, the UI layout would change substantially.

When a ""Swipe down"" action is performed on this screen, it will simply scroll the content downward to reveal more product information, reviews, or similar products that are below the current view. This scrolling action does not involve adding any items to the cart or performing any cart-related operations.

- NEW YORK - STYLE
- THIN & CRISPY (which has a green checkmark indicating it's selected)

Since ""THIN & CRISPY"" is already selected (as shown by the green checkmark) and the user is clicking the confirm button, this indicates that the user has indeed changed the pizza crust to ""THIN & CRISPY"" in this state.

When the cross icon is clicked to delete this timer, the timer will be removed from the interface. Based on typical timer app behavior, after deleting an active timer, the screen would likely return to either:
1. A clean timer setup screen with no active timer
2. The main timer interface in its default state

Since the question asks specifically if the timer will show ""00h 00m 00s"" after deletion, and considering that deleting a timer typically removes it entirely rather than resetting it to zero, the answer is:

When scrolling up on a news feed or article list, new content from above (typically newer articles) will move into view at the top of the screen, while the current top article will move down or off screen.

However, I don't see an Amazon app icon visible on this screen.

1. Swipe to find the Amazon app on another screen/page

When performing a swipe up action to view the Fuel magazine, this would typically scroll down through the magazine grid or navigate to view more magazines. Such navigation actions within the same app interface do not change the system time display in the status bar.

The time shown in the status bar reflects the actual current time and would only change if significant time has passed (enough to change the minute display) or if there were major system-level changes. A simple swipe gesture to view content would not affect the time display.

When a swipe up action is performed on a stats screen like this, it typically scrolls the content vertically to reveal additional information or different time periods (like weekly, monthly, or yearly views). This scrolling action could potentially show stats from a different time period or data range, which would likely result in different average minutes per week values.

Since the swipe up will change what data is being displayed (either different time periods or additional historical data), the average minutes per week value will most likely be different.

When zooming in on a star map or astronomy app, the view becomes more detailed and focused on a smaller area of the sky.

When the Save button is clicked in most video platforms and mobile apps, the typical behavior is to provide immediate feedback to the user confirming that the action was successful. This usually appears as a brief toast message, notification, or visual confirmation.

When swiping up to view the complete menu, additional menu items that are currently below the visible area will be revealed. Based on the menu structure and the fact that this appears to be showing ""Pizze classiche"" (classic pizzas), swiping up would likely reveal more pizza options that follow alphabetically or by menu organization.

Since ""Bismark - normale"" would typically appear earlier in an alphabetical listing (B comes before the currently visible items starting with C, M, V), and given that this appears to be a scrollable menu, it's reasonable that ""Bismark - normale"" would appear when scrolling up to see more of the complete menu.

When performing a ""Go back"" action from this screen, the user would return to a previous screen in the navigation flow. Since ""Fav anime"" is the title of the content being created/edited on this current screen, going back would likely take the user to a different screen entirely (such as a main feed, board view, or previous step in the creation process).

Therefore, the title would change from ""Fav anime"" to whatever title or header is displayed on the previous screen.

After scrolling down, the content above (including the ""Browse topics"" section with various categories like Visual arts, Crafts, Fashion, etc.) will move up and potentially off-screen, while new content from below will become visible. Since the ""Themes"" section is currently at the bottom of the visible area, scrolling down would likely move it up in the viewport but it should still remain visible on the screen.

episode_937/step_014.jpg,Go back,"Is the ""Publish"" button visible in the after state?",Yes,"To answer this question, I need to analyze the current screen and predict what will happen when the ""Go back"" action is performed.

Currently, I can see this is a ""Finishing touches"" screen that appears to be for creating or editing a Pin (likely on Pinterest). The screen shows various fields like adding a title (""Fav anime""), description, ingredients/supplies/notes buttons, link field, board selection, and tagging options. There's also a keyboard visible at the bottom.

When the ""Go back"" action is performed from this ""Finishing touches"" screen, the user would typically return to a previous screen in the Pin creation flow. This would likely be either:

1. The main Pin creation screen where you select/upload the image
2. A screen that shows the Pin content before adding finishing touches
3. The main Pinterest feed/home screen

In Pinterest's typical flow, the ""Publish"" button usually appears on the ""Finishing touches"" screen (the current screen) as the final step to publish the Pin. When going back from this screen, you would return to an earlier step in the creation process where the ""Publish"" button would not yet be available, as it only appears in the final finishing touches step.

When scrolling up, the content will move upward, which means items currently at the top of the screen will move off-screen or become less visible, while items from below will move up to fill the visible area.

Since the ""Naruto Shuriken"" is already at the top of the current view, scrolling up will likely cause it to move out of the visible screen area.

The current view shows a slide titled ""The Hunter"" and at the bottom there are slide thumbnails showing ""1"" and ""2"" with star icons.

When clicking the tick icon at the top left corner, this will likely confirm or save the current action and return to a previous view or close the current editing mode. Based on typical presentation app behavior, clicking the tick/confirm button would exit the current slide editing view and return to a main presentation overview or list view.

In such overview/list views, the current slide number is typically not displayed at the top of the screen, as the focus shifts from individual slide editing to overall presentation management.

There's a tick/checkmark icon in the top left corner.

When clicking the tick icon in a presentation app, this typically saves the current state and exits the editing mode, usually returning to a file browser, main menu, or overview screen where individual presentations are listed.

After clicking the tick icon, the interface will likely transition away from the current editing view to a different screen (such as a file manager or main menu), which means the presentation title ""The Hunter"" that is currently displayed on the slide will no longer be visible.

When swiping up to view the reviews section, this action would typically scroll the page upward to reveal more content, specifically the reviews/feedback section. This would change what's currently visible on screen - the seller information section would likely move up or off-screen, and new content (the reviews) would appear.

When clicking on the 28th of December, this action will select that date in the calendar interface and likely proceed to the next step in the booking process.

episode_20055/step_009.jpg,Select circled W for Wednesday,Is Thursday selected in the alarm settings?,No,"Looking at the current alarm settings screen, I can see the days of the week represented as circles: S, M, T, W, T, F, S. Currently, Monday (M) and Tuesday (T) are highlighted/selected (shown in light green), while Wednesday (W) and the subsequent days including Thursday (the second T) are not selected.

The action is to select Wednesday (W). This will add Wednesday to the selected days for this alarm, but it will not affect the selection state of Thursday.

Since Thursday is currently not selected and the action only involves selecting Wednesday, Thursday will remain unselected after the action is performed.

The action is to select the circled ""W"" for Wednesday, which will modify the days when this alarm is active.

Since this is just selecting an additional day for the alarm to repeat (adding Wednesday to the existing Monday and Tuesday schedule), this is a minor configuration change that won't alter the overall structure or available options of the alarm settings screen.

The ""Add label"" option should remain available after this change, as it's a standard feature for alarm customization that persists regardless of which days are selected.

1. The inbox/email list view
2. A ""message sent"" confirmation screen
3. Return to the previous email interface

In any of these scenarios, the time displayed in the status bar will remain the same (1:24) since this action happens virtually instantaneously and wouldn't cause the minute to change.

When selecting the circled ""W"" for Wednesday, this action will simply add Wednesday to the list of days when the alarm is active. This is a day selection change that doesn't affect the alarm's other settings or options.

Since selecting a day of the week is just modifying the schedule and doesn't change the alarm's feature set or configuration options, the vibrate option will remain visible on the screen.

When scrolling up, the content will move upward, which means elements currently at the bottom of the screen will become more visible, while elements at the top (including the ""In the last 15 days"" metrics section) will move further up and potentially off-screen or become less visible.

When the action ""Select circled W for Wednesday"" is performed, Wednesday will become selected and highlighted, joining Monday and Tuesday as selected days.

Currently selected days: 2 (Monday, Tuesday)

When scrolling up from this position, the screen will move upward to show content that was previously above the current view.

The artworks shown are ""Butterfly"" (US$5,500), ""Motel No-Tell"" (US$3,200), ""Punk Rock Bowling"" (US$3,000), and ""Big Brother Ain't Watchi..."" (US$1,800).

I don't see any artwork titled ""Woman"" currently visible on this screen. Since the action is to scroll down to view more arts by Jonathan LeVine Projects, and there's no ""Woman"" artwork visible in the current view, I cannot determine if scrolling down will reveal a ""Woman"" artwork with its price.

episode_216/step_005.jpg,Click on the right tick key ,Is the number of products displayed on the screen still zero after the change?,No,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a mobile app interface showing ""BLACK DRESS AND"" in the header, with a loading spinner in the center of the screen and ""SORT"" and ""FILTER"" options at the bottom. The screen appears to be in a loading state with no products currently displayed.

When clicking on the right tick key (which appears to be a confirmation or apply action), the loading process will likely complete and products will be loaded and displayed on the screen.

episode_5897/step_002.jpg,Clear the Text bar,Does the timestamp at the top of the screen change between the two images?,No,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the timestamp ""4:14"" displayed at the top of the screen. The action being performed is ""Clear the Text bar"" which will remove the text ""Recording 1"" from the text input field in the dialog box.

This action only affects the content within the text input field and does not involve any time-dependent operations or navigation that would cause the system time to change. The timestamp at the top of mobile device screens represents the current system time, which updates based on real time passage, not user interface actions.

Since clearing text from an input field is an instantaneous local action that doesn't involve time delays or system operations that would cause time to advance, the timestamp will remain the same.

The screen shows ""3 Artworks:"" indicating there are 3 total artworks available.

When swiping up to view more results, the third artwork that is currently not visible will be revealed. Based on the pattern shown where the visible artworks are labeled generically as ""Artwork"", the additional artwork that will appear after swiping up will likely also have a specific title or label.

The screen shows navigation elements at the top and filter/sort options at the bottom, but the main content area is currently loading.

When clicking on the right tick key (which appears to be a confirmation or proceed action), the loading will complete and the screen will display the actual product catalog or search results.

episode_5990/step_001.jpg,go back again,Are the battery and signal icons present in both images?,Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the battery icon (showing what appears to be low battery) and signal/WiFi icons in the top status bar at 8:51.

When the ""go back again"" action is performed, the user will navigate to a previous screen in the app. Based on standard mobile app behavior, going back typically returns to a parent screen or previous view while maintaining the same system-level status bar.

The battery and signal icons are part of the device's status bar, which remains consistent across different screens within apps unless the app specifically hides the status bar or enters fullscreen mode.

Since this appears to be a standard e-commerce app interface showing product reviews, and there's no indication that going back would trigger a fullscreen mode or status bar hiding, the battery and signal icons should remain visible on the next screen.

There's also a loading indicator in the center and what appears to be a yellow banner at the top.

The question asks about clicking ""the right tick key,"" but I don't see any visible tick/checkmark button in the current interface. The main interactive elements visible are the SORT and FILTER buttons at the bottom.

Without being able to identify the specific ""right tick key"" mentioned in the action, and given that the SORT option is currently prominently displayed at the bottom of the interface, it's most likely that the SORT option would remain present after most typical UI interactions on this screen.

No",0.0
episode_216/step_005.jpg,Click on the right tick key ,"Is the ""FILTER"" option still visible after the action was performed?",Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a ""FILTER"" option at the bottom right of the screen. The action described is ""Click on the right tick key"" but I don't see any visible tick/checkmark button in the current interface that would affect the filter option's visibility.

Since there's no clear tick button visible that would logically remove or hide the filter option, and filter options typically remain persistent in e-commerce interfaces unless specifically dismissed, the FILTER option should remain visible after the action.

The user has selected specific dates (Thu, Aug 10 and Tue, Aug 15) and is about to tap the ""Apply"" button.

When the Apply button is tapped, this will likely close the current date selection screen and return to a previous screen that shows search results or travel destinations based on the selected criteria (dates and price range).

episode_5990/step_001.jpg,go back again,Are there fewer reviews displayed after going back?,Yes,"Looking at the current screen, I can see a reviews page showing ""Reviews (6/12)"" at the top, which indicates 6 reviews are currently being displayed out of 12 total reviews. I can see 3 individual review entries visible on the screen.

When performing a ""go back"" action from this reviews page, the user would typically return to a product details page or main product listing page, which would show either no reviews or just a summary/preview of reviews rather than the full reviews listing.

Since going back would take the user away from the dedicated reviews page that shows 6 reviews to a previous page that would show fewer or no individual review entries, there would indeed be fewer reviews displayed.

When swiping up to reach Hindi language, the screen will scroll down to show more language options in the list. Since the ""I want to learn"" section is a fixed header element above the scrollable language list, it will remain visible at the top of the screen even after scrolling.

When swiping up, the screen will scroll down to show more content that's currently below the visible area. I can already see the beginning of the results section at the bottom of the current screen, which shows ""3 Artworks:"" and the start of a grid showing artwork thumbnails, each labeled ""Artwork.""

After swiping up, the main featured artwork and its title ""Artwork"" at the top will likely scroll out of view or become less prominent, and the focus will shift to the results grid below. The individual artwork items in the grid will still be titled ""Artwork,"" but the main featured artwork title at the top will no longer be the primary title visible on screen.

The page displays ""Reviews (6/12)"" at the top and shows multiple product reviews below.

When performing a ""go back"" action from this reviews screen, the user would typically return to the previous screen, which would likely be a product details page or product listing page - not another reviews screen.

When performing a ""go back"" action from this reviews page, the user would typically return to the main product page or previous screen they came from. Product pages and main navigation screens in e-commerce apps typically do not include chat features prominently displayed.

The chat widget currently visible appears to be an overlay or popup element that would likely be dismissed or not carried over when navigating back to a different screen context.

When the search button at the bottom is tapped, this will likely transition to a search results page or main interface of the app where users can browse travel options, accommodations, or services.

When performing a ""Swipe up to view more"" action, this will scroll the content upward to reveal additional information below the currently visible content. However, the status bar at the top of the screen (which contains the time display) will remain fixed in position and unchanged.

The time display will stay the same because:
1. The status bar is a persistent UI element that doesn't change during content scrolling
2. The swipe action only affects the scrollable content area, not the system status bar

When the ""About"" tab is clicked, it will become the active/selected tab, and the content area will change to show information about Leonardo da Vinci rather than the current artwork listings.

The action is to ""Click on the 'Learn to draw'"" but I don't see any explicit ""Learn to draw"" button or text in the current interface. However, based on the context and the presence of the media player controls at the bottom, this appears to be a drawing tutorial or lesson interface.

Since there are already media player controls visible at the bottom with a pause button currently showing, clicking on a ""Learn to draw"" element would likely start or navigate to a drawing tutorial, which would maintain or potentially change the media controls to show a play button instead of the current pause button.

The screen shows customer feedback, review videos, and review images. However, I don't see the specific text ""Top reviews from India"" anywhere on the current screen.

The screen shows a list of recent and saved locations including Long Beach, Upper East Side, Rockaway Beach, and various cafes.

However, I don't see any option specifically labeled as ""current location"" or showing a GPS/location pin icon that would typically indicate the user's current location option. The interface appears to be showing saved locations and recent history, but not the standard ""Use current location"" or ""My location"" option that is commonly found in location selection screens.

When the user types ""Abstract paintings"" in the search bar, this is simply a text input action that will not affect the system status bar elements like the Wi-Fi signal icon. The Wi-Fi signal strength is determined by the actual network connection quality, not by user interface interactions like typing in search fields.

Therefore, the Wi-Fi signal icon will remain unchanged after this action.

The ArtRemix option appears to be selected/highlighted in the top navigation, suggesting clicking on it would activate or open the ArtRemix feature. When this feature is activated, it would likely overlay the current artwork view with remix tools, filters, or editing options, but the underlying artwork and its title would remain visible as the base content being remixed.

When clicking on the ""choose start location"" tab, the interface would likely remain in the same location selection mode or potentially open a text input field for typing a location.

In the paragraph about the Rusalka, I can clearly see the text: ""Rusalki (plural form) are often malicious so her nice smile can be a trap.""

Since this text is already visible in the current state and contains the exact phrase ""nice smile can be a trap,"" and the action is simply to scroll down to view more of the page, this text will still be present in the next state after scrolling.

episode_18078/step_011.jpg,Click on the choose start location tab,"Was ""Long Beach"" still retained in the list after the action?",Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see that ""Long Beach"" appears in multiple places:

1. In the destination field at the top
2. As the first item in the list below with ""NY, USA"" as the location

When clicking on the ""Choose start location"" tab (the top input field), this will likely open a location picker or search interface for selecting the starting point of a journey. The current list showing recent locations including ""Long Beach NY, USA"" would typically remain available as location options in the start location picker.

Since this appears to be a navigation/maps app and ""Long Beach"" is shown as a recent/saved location, it would logically still be retained in the available location options when switching to choose the start location.

When the user scrolls down to view the done button, the screen content will move vertically but the status bar (including the time display) will remain fixed at the top of the screen. The time shown in the status bar reflects the current device time and would only change if actual time passes, not due to scrolling actions within an app.

When the ""Go back"" action is performed, it will return to the previous screen, which would likely be a product listing or search results page.

Since we're going back from the detailed product page to a previous screen, the item will still be displayed, but it will likely appear in a different format - probably as part of a list or grid view rather than the current detailed product page format. The product name ""Solarcourt RCT Racket Sports Shoes"" should still be visible on that previous screen.

When swiping left on a horizontal scrollable interface like this, the content typically moves left, revealing more options on the right side while potentially hiding items on the left side.

Given that ""Quality Checked"" is positioned in the center of the three visible labels, after swiping left to view more options, the ""Quality Checked"" label would likely move toward the left side of the screen but should still remain visible, as it's not at the leftmost position initially.

When scrolling up to read more about moon phase information, the user would be moving to see content that appears above the current view. Since zodiac signs are astronomical calculations based on the moon's position relative to constellations at a specific time, and this appears to be showing current moon phase data, the zodiac sign would remain the same as it's tied to the current astronomical positioning.

When clicking the check icon (✓) at the bottom right, this will likely confirm the search or selection and navigate to the full recipe page for Classic Ratatouille.

When a swipe up action is performed to view details, the screen will scroll upward, revealing more content below while moving the current visible content upward and potentially off-screen. This means the ""Circles, cylinders, cones, and spheres"" section that is currently visible at the top will likely move up and disappear from view as new content from below scrolls into the visible area.

When scrolling up to read more about moon phase information, the azimuth angle would change based on the real-time position of the moon. Since azimuth angles represent the moon's position relative to compass directions and change continuously as the moon moves across the sky, scrolling up (which likely refreshes or updates the data) could result in either an increase or decrease in the azimuth value.

However, without being able to see the actual next screen after the scroll action is performed, I cannot definitively determine whether the specific azimuth angle will increase from 86.33° E.

episode_2093/step_000.jpg,Swipe up to see the care take options ,"Is the care status still marked as ""Easy"" after the swipe?",Yes,"Looking at the current GUI screenshot, I can see that the care status is currently marked as ""Easy"" under the Care section. 

When swiping up to see more care/take options, this action would typically scroll the content upward to reveal additional information or options below the currently visible area. However, the care status information (showing ""Easy"") appears to be part of the static plant details that would remain visible or accessible even after scrolling.

Since the question asks specifically about whether the care status remains marked as ""Easy"" after the swipe, and this appears to be a fundamental characteristic of this plant (Golddust Dracaena) rather than a changeable setting, the care difficulty rating would not change from the swipe action itself.

When the user performs the action ""Scroll down to view old conversation,"" the screen will scroll upward to show earlier messages in the conversation history.

When a swipe up action is performed, the content will scroll upward, moving the currently visible elements higher on the screen and potentially off-screen, while bringing new content from below into view.

The action described is entering an email address in the ""To"" field. This will only change the recipient field and will not affect the email body content.

When swiping up to the Favorites option, this action would typically navigate to a Favorites section or page that shows previously saved or favorited items. This would be a different view from the current Browse topics/Explore page.

Since the question asks about whether there will be a ""Food"" category in the after state (the Favorites page), and Food is not currently visible among the categories on this Explore page, and Favorites pages typically show saved items rather than browsing categories, it's unlikely that a ""Food"" category would appear in the Favorites view.

When scrolling up on this screen, the content will move upward, revealing more text that was above the current visible area. Since this appears to be a continuous article or webpage, and the ""Defying Isolation"" section is currently visible at the bottom, scrolling up would likely show content that comes before this section in the article structure.

The ""Defying Isolation"" content would either remain partially visible or move out of view depending on how much scrolling occurs, but new content from earlier in the article would become visible.

When swiping up to access Favorites, the screen would typically transition to show a Favorites section or menu. Based on the current interface showing various art and cultural categories (Visual arts, Crafts, Fashion, Nature, Design, Travel), and considering that this appears to be an arts/culture app, it's reasonable that a ""Color Explorer"" option could be available in a Favorites section, as color exploration would be relevant to visual arts and design content.

The screen appears to be in the process of saving a document.

When the Save button (which appears to be the action being performed based on the loading state) completes its operation, the app will likely navigate back to a document list or library view where saved documents are displayed.

Since this appears to be saving a new document or page, and the user will be taken to a document library/list view after the save operation completes, there should be document entries visible on the next screen.

There is a ""WOMEN EMPOWERMENT"" event displayed on Saturday, August 5th from 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM.

When clicking on this event, the typical behavior in calendar applications is to navigate to a detailed event view or edit screen for that specific event. This would likely replace the current calendar list view with a dedicated screen showing full details about the Women Empowerment event.

Since the action will transition from the calendar overview to a detailed event view, the event title ""WOMEN EMPOWERMENT"" would still be visible on the next screen, but now as part of the event details page rather than in the calendar list format.

When clicking the ""Save"" button in a mobile app, this action typically takes only a fraction of a second to complete. The save operation would happen so quickly that the time displayed in the status bar would remain the same (3:32) on the next screen.

Mobile device clocks update by the minute, so unless the save action somehow took over 28 seconds to complete (which would be extremely unusual for a simple save operation), the time would not change from 3:32 to 3:33.

Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a ""Create Alert"" button in the top right corner of the screen.

When scrolling down to view more arts by Jonathan LeVine Projects, the screen will likely show a gallery section or listing of artworks. Based on typical mobile app behavior, when scrolling down on an artwork detail page to view more items from a gallery, the top navigation elements (including the ""Create Alert"" button) typically remain visible or accessible.

However, depending on the specific app design, the ""Create Alert"" button might either:
1. Remain fixed at the top of the screen
2. Scroll out of view temporarily but remain accessible
3. Be replaced by different navigation elements

Given that this appears to be an art marketplace app and the ""Create Alert"" functionality is important for user engagement, it's most likely that the button would remain accessible in some form.

1. Changes its text to indicate processing (like ""checking..."" or ""loading..."")
2. Becomes disabled/grayed out
3. Navigates to a new screen entirely

Since the action is ""Tap on check"" and this appears to be some kind of verification or submission process, the button text would likely change from ""चेक करें"" to something else indicating the action is being processed.

The action is to ""Swipe up to view style inspiration."" This action would typically show styling suggestions, outfit combinations, or related items rather than changing the price of the current item being displayed.

When the user clicks ""Continue to app,"" this will navigate away from the current app store/Google Play page and open the ""All recipes Cook Book"" app directly. Since this action involves navigating to a different app, the transition will likely take a few moments to complete, during which time would naturally progress.

Given that app launches typically take at least a few seconds, and considering the normal passage of time during this transition, the time displayed on the device would likely advance from ""10:10"" to ""10:11"" or potentially even further depending on how long the app takes to load and display its interface.

However, since I cannot see what the next screen will actually look like after the click action is performed, and the question asks specifically about whether the time will change after the action, I cannot definitively determine if the time will change just from clicking on the event.

When the Recorder app is opened, it will transition from this home screen to the Recorder app's main interface.

When clicking on this menu icon, a dropdown menu will appear with various options.

Based on the nature of this astronomical/moon tracking app, clicking the 3-dot menu would typically reveal settings and configuration options, which commonly include location settings since moon phases and astronomical data are often location-dependent for accurate timing and visibility information.

episode_15438/step_001.jpg,Click on the tennis tournament.,Is the Tennis Tournament still listed on the screen after the action?,Yes,"Looking at the current screen, I can see a calendar view for November showing various events including a ""Tennis Tournament"" on Monday the 6th at 9-10 AM. 

When clicking on the tennis tournament event, this will typically open a detailed view of that specific event, showing more information about the tournament such as description, location, participants, etc. This would navigate away from the current calendar list view to an event detail screen.

Therefore, the Tennis Tournament would no longer be listed on the screen after the action, as the user would be viewing the detailed event page instead of the calendar list.

At the bottom, there's a ""See more"" link under the Style section.

When clicking on ""See more of product details,"" this action would expand the collapsed product details section to show additional specifications that are currently hidden.

When swiping left on these categories, the categories will shift to reveal more options that are currently hidden off-screen to the right.

However, I notice there is no visible right arrow at the bottom right corner of the screen that could be clicked. The action described mentions clicking a right arrow to ""view the search file,"" but no such element is apparent in the current interface.

Without being able to see the specific UI element that would be clicked or predict exactly what interface would appear next, I cannot definitively determine whether the ""29 minutes ago"" timestamp would still be displayed after the action.

episode_19846/step_000.jpg,Click on the 3 dot icon at the top right corner of the screen.,Does the illumination percentage remain the same in both images?,Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the moon app displaying an illumination percentage of 11% in the center of the screen, and at the bottom showing ""Illumination 13.2%"" under the Meridian passing section.

When clicking on the 3-dot menu icon at the top right corner, this will open a dropdown menu or options panel overlay on top of the current screen. This menu action will not change any of the underlying moon data or calculations - it will simply display additional menu options while the same moon information remains visible in the background.

Therefore, the illumination percentages (both 11% and 13.2%) will remain exactly the same in both the current image and the next image after the menu is opened.

When opening the Artsy app (if it's not already open) or navigating within it, the app would typically maintain its interface structure.

When the user swipes up to view the stop number, this action will reveal more details about the bus stops and schedule information. The swipe up gesture typically expands the bottom panel to show additional transit information while keeping the same route options visible.

Since bus 33 is currently shown as one of the available route options, and a swipe up action to view stop numbers would not remove or change the available bus routes, bus 33 would remain visible in both the current view and the expanded view after the swipe.

If we swipe right from the current SPEED tab, we would move to the FUEL EFFICIENCY tab. Since we're changing from the SPEED category to a different category (FUEL EFFICIENCY), the units would change to fuel efficiency units rather than speed units like ""m/h"".

When swiping right on the ""Latest live drawings"" section, the carousel will move to show different live drawings. Since live drawing timers are continuously counting down in real-time, any timer that was already visible and remains visible after the swipe will show a lower number (having counted down during the transition), not a longer/higher number.

Additionally, if new drawings appear after the swipe, their timers would represent different drawing sessions and wouldn't be ""longer than before"" in the context of the same drawings.

Since going back usually means moving from a detailed view to a more general overview, the resulting screen would show less detailed information about any single item, even if it might show more items in a list or grid format.

When performing a ""Go back"" action, this will typically navigate to a previous screen or close the current view, but this navigation happens very quickly (usually instantaneously or within a second). Since the time is only shown to the minute level (4:02), and the navigation will be nearly instantaneous, the time display will remain the same.

episode_5355/step_006.jpg,Type evan kramer mail id,"Is the ""From"" email address the same in both images?",Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see an email composition interface with:

- From field showing: ""lucaskramer733@gmail.com""
- To field that is currently empty (showing a cursor)
- Subject line about Israel army and Gaza
- A keyboard is displayed at the bottom

The action ""Type evan kramer mail id"" will input text into the ""To"" field where the cursor is currently positioned. This action will not change the ""From"" field, which will remain ""lucaskramer733@gmail.com"".

Since the question asks if the ""From"" email address is the same in both images (current and next), and the typing action only affects the ""To"" field, the ""From"" field will remain unchanged.

episode_11829/step_002.jpg,Go back,Is there an option to search in the after state?,Yes,"Looking at the current screen, I can see this is a science topic page or channel view with stories displayed. There's a back arrow in the top left corner, and when the ""Go back"" action is performed, it will likely return to a previous screen - most likely a main feed, home page, or topic selection screen.

Based on typical mobile app navigation patterns, going back from a specific topic/channel page usually returns to a main interface that would include search functionality as a core feature for content discovery.

episode_1969/step_001.jpg,Click on the miles davis cd option ,"Did the search term change from ""miles davis cd"" to something else after clicking the option?",No,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see a search interface with ""miles davis cd"" in the search bar and a dropdown list of search suggestions that all contain variations of ""miles davis cd"" (like ""miles davis cd lot"", ""miles davis cd box set"", etc.).

When clicking on any of these ""miles davis cd"" options from the dropdown, the search term in the search bar would change from the current ""miles davis cd"" to whichever specific option was selected (such as ""miles davis cd lot"", ""miles davis cd box set"", ""miles davis cd box"", etc.).

Since the question asks if the search term will change from ""miles davis cd"" to something else, and clicking on any of the dropdown options would indeed change it to a more specific variation, the answer is:

episode_6638/step_000.jpg,Go back to the home screen of the app.,"Does the app still display the same features related to ""Sports"" after going back to the previous screen?",No,"Looking at the current screen, I can see this is an ""Alerts"" settings page within a news app that shows various notification categories including ""Sports"" at the bottom with the description ""Global sports news and features.""

When going back to the home screen of the app, the display will change from this alerts/settings configuration page to the main content feed or homepage of the news app. The home screen would typically show news articles, headlines, and content categories rather than the notification settings we see now.

Since ""Sports"" appears here only as a notification preference setting (not as actual sports content), and the home screen would show the main app interface with news content, the sports-related features currently visible (which are just the settings toggle for sports notifications) would not be displayed on the home screen.

episode_3591/step_002.jpg,Enter the Email ID Janedbwpersonatest@gmail.com,"Is the ""From"" email address the same in both images?",Yes,"Looking at the current screenshot, I can see the ""From"" field shows ""coledbwpersonatest@gmail.com"". The action is to enter ""Janedbwpersonatest@gmail.com"" in what appears to be the ""To"" field (which currently shows a cursor).

After performing this action, the ""From"" field will remain unchanged as ""coledbwpersonatest@gmail.com"" since the action is only entering text in the ""To"" field, not modifying the ""From"" field.

Since I can only see one image (the current state) and the question asks about comparing ""From"" addresses in ""both images,"" I need to consider that the ""From"" address will remain the same before and after the action.

When this dropdown is clicked, it will open a menu showing different project-related options. Based on the current UI and typical dropdown behavior, the ""Projects"" option would logically be the first item in its own dropdown menu.

Since the brands appear to be listed alphabetically and the current view shows brands starting with F, G, and H (like Fausto, Fila, Geox, Giorgio, Gliders, Hitz, Hoka), swiping up would reveal brands that come later in the alphabet, including Nike which starts with ""N"".
