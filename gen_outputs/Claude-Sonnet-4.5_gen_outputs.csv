- Search with Google Lens

1. **Context menu dismissal**: The overlay menu would close automatically, as the swipe gesture would be interpreted as a dismissive action or trigger outside the menu bounds.

2. **Page scroll**: The main product listing page behind the menu would scroll downward, revealing:
   - Additional product items that were previously below the visible area
   - More product images and descriptions
   - Potentially new price points and product categories
