The new tab is positioned at the top of the screen, and the visible content of the Amazon page is partially obscured by the tab overview interface.",test,"The action “Tap on the plus icon to open a new tab in the browser” does not apply to the current screenshot.

### Why:
- The screenshot shows the **Amazon shopping cart page** on a mobile browser.
- There is **no plus icon** visible on this page that would open a new tab in the browser.
- The plus icon for opening a new tab is typically located in the browser’s UI (e.g., at the top of the screen next to the address bar or in the tab bar), not on the content of a webpage like the Amazon cart.

### What will happen if you tap the correct “plus” icon:
If you tap the **plus icon in the browser’s tab bar** (which is not visible here), a new tab will open, allowing you to browse other websites.

### What will happen if you tap the “+” icon on the product page:
The “+” icon next to the quantity selector for the ASUS Zenbook (not the browser’s tab control) will **increase the quantity** of that item in the cart.

---

### Conclusion:
The action you described cannot be performed on this screen. You will need to locate the browser’s tab control (usually at the top or bottom of the screen) to open a new tab. If you tap the “+” icon on the product page, it will increase the quantity of the item in the cart, not open a new tab.",3.0,2,4,9,web_shopping
